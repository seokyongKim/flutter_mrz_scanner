## 3.1.0

- Temporarily disabled the Document Crop feature due to issues with document size inconsistencies.
- Added a feedback mechanism run /example `camera_page.dart` to view it,used for real-time interaction, providing users with updates instead of displaying a static loading screen.
- Implemented MRZ character replacement to address known OCR detection issues.

## 3.0.9

-Enhanced iOS implementation to align with the Android improvements.
-Further testing is needed—unfortunately, I can't test it on iOS. If anyone with an iOS device could help and get in touch, I'd really appreciate it. You can find my contact details on my GitHub page.

## 3.0.8

# MRZ Cropping Enhancement  
**Unified Function:** Introduced a single function, `calculateCutoutRect(Bitmap bitmap, Boolean cropToMRZ)`, which now supports two cropping modes:

- **Document Crop:** When `cropToMRZ` is `false`, the image is cropped to the full document area with a 10% margin expansion (adjustable if needed; change `val marginPercentage = 0.1`, where `0.1` is 10%).  
- **MRZ Crop:** When `cropToMRZ` is `true`, the image is cropped to only the MRZ area (35% of the document frame's height), accurately matching the measurements from the Flutter overlay.

# Improved Accuracy  
**Consistent Document Ratio:** The cropping calculations now use the same document frame ratio (86/55) and center the document area within the bitmap, ensuring consistent results across both native Android and Flutter overlays.


- val cropped = calculateCutoutRect(rotated, true) // use false if you don't want to crop to MRZ area

# Bug Fixes
Correct Cropping Values: Fixed issues where incorrect cropping values might have been applied, ensuring the correct area is captured for MRZ scanning.

Enjoy the enhanced MRZ scanning functionality!
